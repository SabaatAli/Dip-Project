# Dip-Project
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on automatic skin lesion segmentation using Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques and Python. The goal is to accurately separate the lesion area from dermoscopic images, which is a crucial step in early skin cancer detection.

⚙️ Working Methodology
The project follows these major steps:
1.	Image Loading
o	Dermoscopic images and their corresponding ground truth masks are loaded.
o	Images are resized for consistency.
2.	Preprocessing
o	Conversion from BGR to grayscale.
o	Noise reduction and enhancement (if applied).
3.	Segmentation
o	Thresholding and image processing techniques are used to segment the lesion region.
o	Binary masks are generated to isolate the lesion.
4.	Evaluation
o	The predicted mask is compared with the ground truth mask.
o	A confusion matrix is used to measure performance (accuracy, precision, recall).
5.	Visualization
o	Original image, grayscale image, segmented output, and ground truth are displayed for comparison.
